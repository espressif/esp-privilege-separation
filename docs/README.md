# Building Documentation

The documentation is built using the python package esp-docs, which can be installed by running `pip install esp-docs`. Running `build-docs --help` will give a summary of available options. For more information see the esp-docs documentation at https://github.com/espressif/esp-docs/blob/master/README.md
